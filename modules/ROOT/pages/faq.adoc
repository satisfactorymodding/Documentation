[id="Installation"]
== How do I install mods?

See the directions on xref:ForUsers/SatisfactoryModManager.adoc[here] to install Satisfactory Mod Manager
and use it to install mods.

== How do I turn off mods?

_Or: 'How do I disable mods?'_

_Or: 'How do I uninstall my mods?'_

_Or: 'How do I go back to play the vanilla game?'_

The mod manager handles putting mod files in the relevant locations in your game install.
If you launch the game outside of the mod manager,
those files will still be in those folders, so you will still have your mods loaded.
If you want to turn off mods, you must disable them **from the mod manager** so the files get removed.

If you want to turn off a single mod, press the pause button next to its name in the mod list.

To turn off mods entirely, flip the "Mods" switch in the top left corner of the mod manager.

image:FAQ/TurnOffMods.png[Satisfactory Mod Manager Off Switch]

If for some reason this still doesn't work, delete the "Mods" folder from your
link:#_where_are_my_game_files_located[game's install directory].

Do note **uninstalling the mod manager will not uninstall mods from your game**.
If you did that, you should reinstall the mod manager and turn the mods off using the above approach.

If you're trying to remove a specific mod from your mod manager profile and it's not working,
try creating a new profile.
You could also try
link:#_how_do_i_share_my_mods_with_my_friends_for_multiplayer[exporting your profile],
editing the file to delete the mod listing, then importing it again.

== The mod manager can't find my game!

You might see error messages like:

- `No Satisfactory Installs Found`

SMM queries the APIs of the Epic and Steam game store apps to determine where your game is.
If you manually moved the game files after installation, your installer client will not know where it is.
We do not support pirated copies of the game.

If you're playing on Steam, you need to point Steam to the new library folder.
To do that in the top left click "Steam", select "Settings", in "Downloads" tab press "Steam library folders" and add the folder that you moved your game files to.
More information can be found on this
https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327[Steam help page].

If you're playing on Epic Games, you have to reinstall the game as Epic Games Launcher does not have an option to locate the game files.

Moving or reinstalling will not affect your save files.

== Can I add mods to a save I've already started?

It varies depending on the mod, but in general, yes, this is totally fine.
The mod should say on its mod page on ficsit.app if it can't be added to an in-progress game.

[id="FindMissingMods"]
== Can I find out what mods I was using in a save file if I lost the mod manager profile?

Yes, SML keeps a record of what mods a save file was using, and their versions, within the save header.

The easiest way to see this is to install the link:https://ficsit.app/mod/SML[Satisfactory Mod Loader] mod and try to load the save file again.
A pop-up will appear with a list of the mods that were used in the save file.
If the pop-up is too long, the rest of the list will be in the link:#Files_Logs[game's log file].

Alternatively, you can open your save file in a text editor, as the save header modded data is not currently compressed.
Line 3 will contain a JSON object of the format `{"Version":1,"Mods":[{"Reference":"ModReferenceHere","Name":"Mod User Facing Display Name Here","Version":"SemVerHere"},]}`.
Keep in mind that large save files can crash some text editors.

[id="MultiplayerSupport"]
== Do mods work with multiplayer?

[id="MultiplayerSupport_ShortAnswer"]
=== Short Answer

Not all mods work with multiplayer, but most of them do.
It is up to the mod developer to communicate to you if their mod works in multiplayer.
Usually there will be text or an image on the mod's page on ficsit.app with information about multiplayer support.
If the mod page doesn't say yet, try it out yourself and see!

All players in multiplayer generally require the exact same mods installed to play together.
To share your mods with other players,
see link:#_how_do_i_share_my_mods_with_my_friends_for_multiplayer[this section].

As a general rule of thumb,
if the mod only adds recipes, items, or buildings that have no custom logic
(behave exactly like base-game ones with a new model, or for recipes that the mod adds)
then it usually works.

Sometimes a mod that is not coded correctly for multiplayer will still work just for the host player.
It's up to you to decide if that's good enough for your group.

[id="MultiplayerSupport_LongAnswer"]
=== Long Answer

There are two kinds of multiplayer in Satisfactory.
A mod may be compatible with both, one, or neither of them.

* **Host-and-Play**
** One game client runs the game for the host player and allows other players to connect
** Requires the mod to be coded with multiplayer functionality in mind, else _it will only work for the host player_
** The mod developer should have written something on the mod page telling you if the mod is multiplayer compatible or not
* **Dedicated Server**
** One server executable hosts allows others to connect
** Requires the mod to be coded with multiplayer functionality in mind, else _it will work for no one_ (since there is no longer a host player)
** The Mod Repository can tell you if a mod works for dedicated servers, see link:#DoModsWorkOnDedicatedServers[this section] for more info.
** If a mod works for dedicated servers, it usually also works for host-and-play

There are also three kinds of mods with respect to multiplayer:

* Both-sided mods
** The most common varaint
** This mod must be present on both the host and the clients to work
* Server-side mods
** This mod only needs to be present on the host side to work - clients do not need to have it installed
** Sometimes these mods only support dedicated servers - they will not function in host-and-play
* Client-side mods
** This mod only needs to be present on the client side to work - the host does not need to have it installed. However, the host having it installed may enable additional functionality for clients.

Assume that mods are both-sided unless explicitly stated otherwise by the mod page or the
xref:ForUsers/DedicatedServerSetup.adoc#CheckModDedicatedServerSupport[dedicated server compatibility grid].

== How do I share my mods with my friends for multiplayer?

You can use the Mod Manager's profile import/export functionality.

image:FAQ/SmmImportExport.png[SMM Import/Export screenshot]

[id="DoModsWorkOnDedicatedServers"]
== Do mods work with dedicated servers?

_Or: How do I tell if a mod works on Dedicated Servers?_

In general, mods do work on dedicated servers, but exact support will vary depending on the mod.
See xref:ForUsers/DedicatedServerSetup.adoc[Installing Mods on Dedicated Servers] for more details.
The xref:ForUsers/DedicatedServerSetup.adoc#CheckModDedicatedServerSupport['Checking if a Mod Supports Dedicated Servers' section]
describes how to tell if an individual mod supports Dedicated Servers.

== Are Satisfactory mods safe?

_Or: 'Why does Satisfactory Mod Manager trigger my antivirus?'_

Using Satisfactory mods is safe, as long as you only download mods from ficsit.app and install them via the https://smm.ficsit.app/[Mod Manager].

All files uploaded to ficsit.app are tested for malware and such before they are approved for download.
Downloading arbitrary files always comes with some level of risk, but this procedure minimizes that risk.

Your computer may claim that the Mod Manager is unsafe when you try to open it.
This should rarely, if ever, happen since the mod manager has a code signing certificate as of SMM3.
If you see it, just approve it running.

But rest assured, this community created Satisfactory Mod Manager from scratch.
We all use it. Provided you only download SMM from
https://smm.ficsit.app/
or its https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModManager/releases[GitHub releases page]
we can assure you it is safe.
You can find the source code for it here: https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModManager

== How do I use <insert mod name here>?

See the xref:ForUsers/Welcome.adoc#GettingInfoAboutMods[welcome guide].

== Do mods work with Experimental?

**If a major update has recently released to Experimental, there's a good chance NO mods will work on the Experimental branch!**
**Check the Discord's #announcements channel for more up-to-date status information.**

It is up to the mod developer to support Satisfactory's experimental branch.
Check the mod's page on ficsit.app, or the mod manager extended details, for support.

Once you're on the page, check mods' Compatibility via two stickers found in the description.
The rocket icon indicates Early Access and the flask icon is for Experimental.

In the Mod Manager:

image:FAQ/SmmCompatibilityInfo.png[SMM Compatibility Info screenshot]

On ficsit.app:

image:FAQ/FicsitAppCompatibility.png[ficsit.app Compatibility Info screenshot]

You can hover over the sticker for any notes that may have been left by the author.
They may indicate a version to use, which you can change to in the Mod Manager with the dropdown right above the stickers.

- *Green - Working*:
  The mod should be functioning as intended.
- *Yellow/Orange - Damaged*:
  Something is wrong with the mod that is causing it to work improperly,
  but it is partially working.
  Be sure to click the icon to see an explanation of what is going wrong!
- *Red - Broken*:
  This mod is suffering from a critical problem,
  and could do things like crash your game at launch if you were to install it.
  Be sure to click the icon to see an explanation of what is going wrong!

Please note, these are updated manually, and may be slightly out of date.
If you find a mod that is missing its stickers or ones that seem to be incorrect,
please let us know in the Discord (including a SMM debug zip if it does not work is useful as well!)
and we will investigate and update the info if necessary.

[id="ModsDoNotDisableAchievements"]
== Do mods disable achievements?

No - using mods does not disable achievements in Satisfactory.
Note that the base game's https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Advanced_Game_Settings[Advanced Game Settings] do disable achievements.

== Satisfactory Mod Manager is open, but I can't see its window!

The program's window somehow got offscreen.
We're still not sure what causes this.
To fix it you need to edit the `%appdata%\SatisfactoryModManager\settings.json` file
and within the `windowLocation` property, set the `x` and `y` to 0 to bring the window back on the screen.

Restart SMM after you do that.

== Where do I get help with a mod that is not in the mod portal?

We try to keep everything we work on organized through the ficsit.app mod portal.
If you need help with something that isn't there,
check the mod's information page for a mod-specific discord to join,
or ask nicely in the `#help-using-mods` discord channel.

== What happens if I open up a save without mods installed?

If you were to load up a save file without mods,
all of the content from those mods will simply vanish from the save,
and the game should load just fine with no modded content.

Keep in mind that after saving the game after loading it with no mods,
the modded content would be permanently gone from that point on.
So, if you want to keep modded content, don't play in that save without your mods installed!

If you ever load a save without mods by accident,
just quit the game without saving and launch the game with your mods, your content should still be there.

== How do I make my own mod?

Check out
xref:index.adoc#_for_developers[this section of the home page]
for more information.

== Where are my game files located?

[id="Files_GameInstall"]
=== Game Install

The location of your game files depends on how you installed the game.

[id="Files_GameInstall_Steam"]
==== Steam

The default path is
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Satisfactory`.

You can use the below approach to find your exact install location:

image:FAQ/LocalFiles_Steam.png[Browse Local Files on Steam]

[id="Files_GameInstall_Epic"]
==== Epic

Note that the Early Access and Experimental branches are separate library entries with separate install directories!

image:FAQ/LocalFiles_Epic.png[Browse Local Files on Epic]

[id="Files_GameInstall_Other"]
==== Other

Dedicated Server, Linux, and Mac install locations vary significantly depending on how you set them up.

In a Crossover (Mac) install, assuming your bottle is named "Steam", files will be at
// NOTE: this path has been escaped with a \ in the source text to avoid an irrelevant docs compile warning https://discuss.asciidoctor.org/skipping-reference-to-missing-attribute-td7687.html
`"$\{HOME}/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/Steam/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Satisfactory"`

[id="Files_Mods"]
=== Mods

As described link:#_how_do_i_turn_off_mods[here],
the Mod Manager handles downloading and placing mod files into the correct folder for you.
Interfering with mod files manually is not recommended,
and the Mod Manager is likely to undo or overwrite your changes.

Mods are stored in the link:#Files_GameInstall[game install directory] under `FactoryGame/Mods`.

[id="Files_SaveFiles"]
=== Save Files

See link:#_how_do_i_backup_my_save_files[Backing Up Save Files]

[id="Files_Blueprints"]
=== Blueprint Designer Files

Check out the https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Blueprint#Save_Location[Official Wiki's information on Blueprint Designer files].

Remember that the folder may not exist if you haven't created a blueprint yet.

[id="Files_GameConfig"]
=== Game Configuration Files

The options you have selected in the base game's options menu are stored in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\FactoryGame\Saved\Config\Windows\GameUserSettings.ini`

Note that this file stores differences from the default settings, so if you have not changed a setting,
it will not be listed.

[id="Files_ModConfig"]
=== Mod Configuration Files

Mod configuration files are stored in the link:#Files_GameInstall[game install directory] under `FactoryGame/Configs`.

Note that some mods may have custom implementations or extra files that are not stored in this location.

[id="Files_Logs"]
=== Log Files

You can find various log files at different locations:

* `FactoryGame.log` is produced by running the game and includes both base-game and mod log messages.
  ** The game client this file is stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/FactoryGame/Saved/logs`
  ** Dedicated servers could have this file in `InstallDirectoryHere/FactoryGame/Saved/logs`
    or potentially another location depending on how the server is hosted
* (For mod developers) The Unreal Editor's crash logs can be found in one of the following locations
  depending on when/how it crashed:
  ** `%appdata%\Unreal Engine\AutomationTool\Logs\`
  ** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\UnrealEngine\<the engine version here>\Saved\Logs`
  ** `<your modding project folder>\Saved\Logs`
* Satisfactory Mod Manager's internal log files can be found at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SatisfactoryModManager\logs`

[id="Files_SMMProfiles"]
=== Mod Manager Profiles

Mod manager profiles are stored at:

`%appdata%\ficsit\profiles.json`

Any legacy SMM2 profiles should be automatically migrated to SMM3, but if not, they can be found here:

`%appdata%\SatisfactoryModManager\profiles`

[id="Files_Screenshots"]
=== Game Screenshots

Game screenshots are stored in:

`%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\FactoryGame\Screenshots`

== Where can I find the game's log files?

The easiest way to gather logs is the Mod Manager's "generate debug info" feature,
since it gathers game, SML, and Mod Manager logs for you.

image:FAQ/SmmGenerateDebugInfo.png[SMM Generate Debug Info screenshot]

The location of these files is mentioned link:#Files_Logs[above].

== How do I verify my game files?

On Steam:

image:FAQ/SteamVerifyIntegrity.png[Steam screenshot]

On Epic:

image:FAQ/EpicVerifyIntegrity.png[Epic screenshot]

== The mod manager can't download any mods

You might see messages like:

// cspell:words ETIMEDOUT
- `error while downloading file [...] Premature close`
- `Error 3 attempts to download <ModName> failed`
- `Error: Unexpected error while downloading file connect ETIMEDOUT`
- `The server aborted pending request`

Something is causing the download to be cut off early.
It could sometimes be due to your internet speed or interruptions in the connection.
Mod files are hosted on Backblaze B2 and SML releases are hosted on GitHub.
Try disabling the mod manager's timeout as shown below.

If that still doesn't work, try
link:#_why_is_the_mod_manager_downloading_slowly_or_failing_to_download[this approach instead].

image:FAQ/SmmDisableDownloadTimeout.png[Timeout disable screenshot]

== Why is the mod manager downloading slowly, or failing to download?

You might see error messages like:

// cspell:words getaddrinfo ENOENT ECONNRESET
- `Unexpected error while downloading file: getaddrinfo ENOENT github.com`
- `Unexpected error while downloading file: read ECONNRESET`
- `Unexpected error while downloading file: unable to verify the first certificate`
- `Unexpected error while downloading file: self signed certificate in certificate chain`

Internet restrictions, and sometimes VPNs and proxies, mess with our services.
You can work around this by downloading the mod files mentioned in the error message from ficsit.app manually.
The process for doing this changes if you're using SMM2 or SMM3 and is described below.
You can also try using a different proxy, VPN, or hotspot to download the mod instead.

Once you have downloaded the mod file(s) from ficsit.app,
place the zips into `%localappdata%\ficsit\downloadCache`.
Make sure to rename them to the `ModReference_version_target.zip` format, for example,
`SML_3.7.0_Windows.zip`

== How can I troubleshoot crash issues?

The easiest way to gather logs is the Mod Manager's "generate debug info" feature and send the file on the Modding Discord's `#help-using-mods` discord channel.

image:FAQ/SmmGenerateDebugInfo.png[SMM Generate Debug Info screenshot]

If someone helping you asks you to, you can copy your the list of mods you currently have installed to your clipboard with this button.

image:FAQ/SmmCopyModList.png[Screenshot of the "Copy Mod List" button in the "Mod Manager Settings" menu]

You can also follow this process to track down which mod(s) you have installed are leading to a crash (or other undesired behavior):

image:FAQ/DebugModsFlowchart.png[Troubleshooting flowchart]

== How can I tell what mod added an item/milestone/recipe/thing?

Consider using the https://ficsit.app/mod/TFIT[TFIT - The Ficsit Information Tool]
and https://ficsit.app/mod/MAMTips[MAM Enhancer]
mods, which add tools to help you identify content.

== I'm having VRAM issues, how do I fix them?

If you're having trouble with VRAM usage
it's important to understand the two things that are the biggest contributions:
graphics settings and texture content.
Other things contribute, but there are a smaller fraction than these. 
Additionally, with multiple monitors and/or other programs running,
they will also eat up available VRAM,
so consider closing extraneous programs
especially things that are highly dynamic like streaming apps.

The more mods you use that add more texture content,
the more they will eat up your VRAM.
This is a direct relationship that can't be change by any settings or details from the user's end.
It is unlikely to be a single mod causing the problem.
It is a death by a thousand small cuts
and every mod author has to do their best,
but more content means more space is used.

If removing mod content is not desirable the other option is to adjust your graphics settings.
Even at minimum there are extensive options Unreal provides for you to tune it even lower.
These may cause unforeseen glitches and issues so be careful with them.

https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/can-you-change-graphics-settings-with-console-commands/308720

== Can I put the Mod Manager on a drive other than my C drive?

SMM3's cache location can be changed via `Mod Manager Settings` > `Change cache location`.

== Why are my game's textures blurry or low resolution?

No particular mod causes your textures to be low resolution -
it's a base-game/engine bug that can be exacerbated by mods.
Unreal engine "streams" in low resolution textures at first and then gradually loads better versions.
This process is getting stuck and thus some textures stay low resolution.
In terms of fixing it there's three different things you can try.

1. Try swapping your graphics mode between DX12/Vulkan/etc. Different people have different levels of success with each.
2. Randomly pick mods that add a lot of new textures you aren't that into and uninstall them. It's never a specific mod.
3. Try turning down some graphics settings or upgrading your graphics card. The issue has been reported on 30XX series though.

== How do I start the game with launch arguments?

Launch arguments are special options passed to the game at startup to control its behavior. 

The process for specifying them depends on how you are launching the game:

- For https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/7d01-d2dd-d75e-2955[Steam] 
- For https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:Command_line_arguments#Epic_Games_Store[Epic]
- For a https://superuser.com/questions/29569/how-to-add-command-line-options-to-shortcut[Windows shortcut]
- For xref:Development/TestingResources.adoc[Testing Scripts]
- For other launch methods, use your search engine of choice.

== How do I get the Experimental or Early Access Branch of the Game?

Note that you may have to link:#_how_do_i_turn_off_mods[turn off your mods]
for the game to launch after you switch branches, especially after a major update.

On Steam, right click the game, select properties, select the betas tab and opt into Experimental in the dropdown list. "None" is Early Access and "experimental - experimental" is Experimental.

image:FAQ/SteamBranch.png[Steam Installer]

In the Epic Games Launcher they should be available as separate games. If either is not there, try restarting the launcher.
image:FAQ/EpicBranch.png[Epic Installer]

[id="PlayOlderVersion"]
== How do I play an older version of the game?

You may wish to download an older version of the game
in order to play with mods that are not yet updated.

=== Make a Backup

The easiest way to use an older copy of the game is to plan for it in advance.
This works for both the Epic and Steam distributions of the game.

First, turn off automatic updates for Satisfactory so that when Coffee Stain releases an update,
you can make a backup copy of your game files before the platform automatically downloads the update.
Note that neither Steam nor Epic offer the ability to permanently turn off updates,
so instead, chose the option that makes it so it only updates when you launch it
(instead of automatically in the background).
This gives you a chance to copy the files elsewhere before the platform automatically updates them on you.

- Steam explains how to disable automatic updates in
https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable[their FAQ].
- Epic automatic updates can be disabled on the game's "Manage" menu.
  Remember to disable updates for each Satisfactory library entry, since the branches are separate games on Epic.

Once automatic updates are disabled, take a backup by copying the entire game install directory to another location.

==== Launching the Backup Copy

In order to launch this separate copy, you'll need to launch it outside of the usual platform launcher.

- For Steam, navigate to the `\Engine\Binaries\Win64` subfolder of your backup copy and create a text file named `steam_appid.txt` with the file contents `526870`.
  To launch the game, run the `FactoryGameSteam.exe` file in the root folder of your backup copy.
  If you have Steam open, it will still say you are playing, but your backup will still be separate and not require Steam.
- For Epic, you will need to run the game executable with launch arguments to prevent it from talking to the Epic Games launcher.
  Create a Windows shortcut pointing to the game executable and add the `-EpicPortal` and `-NoSteamClient` arguments.
  https://superuser.com/questions/29569/how-to-add-command-line-options-to-shortcut[This article] explains how to add launch arguments to a shortcut.

[id="PlayOlderVersion_SteamCMD"]
=== Use SteamCMD

[WARNING]
====
We do not provide support for using older versions of the game.
By following this process, you are volunteering to fix any issues that may arise yourself,
and you are accepting the risk of possible data loss.
====

Unfortunately, this process is only possible if you own the game on Steam -
Epic Games has not created a system that allows for this.

This guide is written for Windows, but similar steps can probably be used on Linux with some changes.

1. Modify Steam's update settings for Satisfactory
so that Steam will only try to update the game when you launch it
instead of automatically in the background.
Steam explains how to do this on
https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable[their documentation].
Don't worry, a later step will ensure that Steam doesn't try to update the game even when you launch it.

2. Find the manifest ID for the version you want to download.
The easiest way to do this is on the https://steamdb.info/app/526870/[SteamDB page for Satisfactory].

.. Go to the `Depots` section and find the Depot row for the game files.
   The game client is `526871`
   and the dedicated server is `526872`.
   Click on the "ID" number for that row.
.. Click the `Manifests` section.
   You can optionally use the "Filter branch" option
   to show just Stable ("public") or Experimental ("experimental").
.. Find the row that corresponds to when the update you want was released,
   for example, Update 8.3 is `12 December 2023 – 16:28:20 UTC`.
   Copy the manifest ID from this row for usage later.
   For example, Update 8.3's manifest ID is `3783838377491884235`.

3. Open the Windows Run dialog.
You can find it in "Start programs" or by using Win+R shortcut.
Enter this command in the dialog while Steam the client window is open:
`steam://open/console`

4. Navigate to the newly-revealed extra tab in your Steam app called 'Console'.
It may take a few seconds to load after you run the command.

5. Prepare a download_depot command for the version you wish to download in the text box.
The format is: `download_depot appId depotId targetManifestId`.
Satisfactory's appId is `526870`.
For example, the command to download Update 8.3 would be `download_depot 526870 526871 3783838377491884235`

6. Make sure you have enough space (~30GB) in **the drive that you installed Steam on**.
**Important note - this is NOT your game installation folder!**
Again, this will be the same folder you have installed the Steam program on, not a library folder.
If you haven't changed it during installation of Steam, it will probably be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\`.
Once you're sure you have enough space, execute the command by pressing Enter.

7. Steam will now download the depot into a new folder.
Continuing the previous examples, the folder would be
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_526870\depot_526871`.
This will take a while (the whole game is being downloaded again from scratch), and **there's no progress bar.**
Once it's done, an extra line will appear in the Steam console announcing the command's completion.
If you get an "access denied" error, make sure you have formatted the command correctly and try again.
The command can still fail with no formatting issues;
if this occurs, you will have to run the command again until it succeeds.

8. Open up your **game installation folder** - not the depot this time.
You can find your folder by following link:#Files_GameInstall[these directions].
Make a backup up the folder's contents by copying them to another location
since we will be deleting files.

9. Delete all of the files from your game installation folder EXCEPT for these:
* `Manifest_DebugFiles_Win64.txt`
* `Manifest_NonUFSFiles_Win64.txt`
* `Manifest_UFSFiles_Win64.txt`
* `/FactoryGame/Configs/`(this folder contains your mod configuration files)
* `/FactoryGame/Mods/` (this folder contains the mods you have already installed. If you want to keep them, don't delete the folder)
* Other mods may also produce folders and files you want to keep.
  This is why you took a backup earlier -
  you can get those files from the backup if you need to.
// Don't break list but keep this in a new paragraph 
+
Reusing these manifest files tricks Steam into thinking that the contents of the folder are that of the latest depot,
when in reality they are the past version you just downloaded,
meaning Steam won't try to update the files before you launch.
This means you can play without putting Steam in offline mode.

10. Move in the files produced by the download depot command you ran earlier.
If prompted to replace files, keep the already existing files.

11. Download the mods you want to play with into this new copy of the game.
You may be able to reuse some of them from your backup copy (`/FactoryGame/Mods`).
Just like Steam, the mod manager doesn't know that this copy is an older version,
so you may have to do a lot of work at this step to make sure you've grabbed compatible mod versions.
Remember, we will not provide support for this process, you're on your own here.

12. You should be good to go.
In order to launch the game, simply launch it through Steam or the mod manager as usual.
If you've followed these steps correctly, Steam will not try to update the game when you launch it.
Once you are certain all data has been transferred, feel free to remove your backup of the previous folder contents.


* In order to revert this process and return to the latest version of the game,
  link:#_how_do_i_verify_my_game_files[use Steam to verify your game files].

== How do I play both an older modded version and the latest update?

[WARNING]
====
We do not provide support for using older versions of the game.
By following this process, you are volunteering to fix any issues that may arise yourself,
and you are accepting the risk of possible data loss.
====

First, you'll need a copy of the old version of the game.
Follow the steps link:#PlayOlderVersion[here] to set one up.

1. While the old version is still in your Steam/Epic folders, use SMM to add the mods you want.
You WILL NOT be able to use SMM to manage mods for copies outside of your launcher's folder,
so make sure that you have all the mods you want
and that the game runs at a level of stability you're happy with.
You may need to switch to an older version of SMM or install mods manually.
Remember, we offer no support for this process - you're on your own here.

2. Copy your entire game install directory to another location on your computer.
Expect it to take up about 30 gigabytes.

3. Create a shortcut for the `.exe` file in the game's root directory, usually `FactoryGameSteam.exe`.
One way to do this is to right click on it and select create shortcut.

4. Open the shortcut's properties from the right click menu.
Under the "Shortcut" settings tab, modify the "Target" line to end in `-NoSteamClient -EpicPortal`.
Make sure you have a space between the file path and this launch argument.

5. You now have a standalone version of the game that will not update or talk to Steam.
This means you won't be able to play online with anyone through this version.

6. Navigate to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames`.
Open the folder named a long stream of numbers (this is your launcher user id)
and copy any save files you wish to access from the standalone version into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames\common`.
The standalone copy isn't linked to your launcher
and thus wont be able to see the save games in the launcher-user-specific folder.

7. Test launching the standalone copy of the game with your shortcut.

8. Once you are certain the standalone copy is working, go back into your launcher and 
link:#_how_do_i_verify_my_game_files[verify your game files]
to restore your launcher's copy to the latest update.

9. You can now play the old copy of the game by using your shortcut
while still being able to play the latest version via your launcher. 

== How do I backup my save files?

_Or: 'Where are my save files stored?'_

It is suggested to routinely backup your save files, especially when the game updates.
You may copy them to the same disk/drive, a USB stick, the cloud, or anywhere you feel would make your save files be safe.

Both Steam and Epic Games version use the same PATH depending on OS used.
Note that "{Your ID}" in the below examples refers to a unique user ID number, not the literal text "{Your ID}".

=== Windows

Both of the paths listed below lead to the same location, either will work.

Path 1:

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames\{YOUR ID}`

Path 2:

`\Users\{your Windows username}\AppData\Local\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames\{YOUR ID}`

If you cannot find your steam save folder (probably because you have owned the game in Epic and just bought the Steam copy recently), first start a new game with Steam, then save the new game. You should now be able to see your steam save folder beside epic. The steam ID is usually shorter than the Epic ID. The folder location is stated above.

=== Linux

Using Steam (Native):

// cspell:ignore steamapps compatdata steamuser valvesoftware
`~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/526870/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/FactoryGame/Saved/SaveGames/{YOUR STEAM ID}`

Using Steam (Flatpak):

`~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/526870/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/FactoryGame/Saved/SaveGames/{YOUR STEAM ID}`

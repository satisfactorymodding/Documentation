= SML Commands

[TIP]
====
If you're looking to create your own chat commands, check out
xref:Development/ModLoader/ChatCommands.adoc[this page].
====

SML adds two kinds of commands to the game by default,
link:#_chat_commands[*Chat Commands*]
and link:#ConsoleCommands[*Console Commands*].

== Chat Commands

These commands can be run *from the in-game chat window* prefixed with a `/`.
For example, to run the 'help' command, you'd enter `/help` into chat.

Note that only the player who runs the command will see the command output.

Chat commands added by mods will also show up when you run `/help`.

Also lists all currently loaded mods.

[id="ConsoleCommands"]
== Console Commands

These commands can be run *from the in-game developer console*
which is opened when you press the grave/tilde key (``` or `~`).
If the console does not open upon keypress, check out the
https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Console#Accessing[Satisfactory Wiki's page on the Console]
to try alternate approaches.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In order to use these commands the "Enable Cheats" Session Setting must be enabled for the save.
Furthermore, you must run the `EnableCheats` console command once in the game session before any of the other console commands will work.
Because of how the command is implemented, the game will claim that the command is not recognized when you run it,
but assuming you enabled the session setting correctly, other cheat console commands will then begin to function.
====

[TIP]
====
If you plan to use console commands frequently,
consider installing a mod that will automatically enable cheats for you such as
https://ficsit.app/mod/NogsCheats[Nog's Cheats].

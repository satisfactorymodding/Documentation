== Creating an Actor Mixin

Creating a Mixin (formerly known as a SCS Hook) is similar to creating a Blueprint Hook.

Within the Editor, create a new Blueprint of the type "Blueprint Mixin"

When creating it you will be given a prompt to choose which Actor to add the Mixin to.

Upon opening the Mixin you will be presented with an empty graph. The components of the Actor you are hooking will also be shown.

There are a few functions you can override.

If you intend to use "Tick" make sure you check "Enable Mixin Tick".

== Registering the Mixin

Actor Mixins must be registered in a
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc[Game Instance Module] to be applied in-game.
Create a Mod Game Instance Module if you don't already have one and add your new Mixin to the "Blueprint Hooks" array.

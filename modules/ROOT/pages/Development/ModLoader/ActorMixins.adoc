== Creating an Actor Mixin

Creating a Mixin (formerly known as a SCS Hook) is similar to creating a Blueprint Hook.

Within the Editor, create a new Blueprint of the type "Blueprint Mixin"

When creating it you will be given a prompt to choose which Actor to add the Mixin to.
Note that unlike Blueprint Hook assets, each Mixin asset can only have hooks for a single Actor class.

Upon opening the Mixin you will be presented with an empty graph. The components of the Actor you are hooking will also be shown.

TODO can you add new components here and have them be added to the actor?

There are a few functions you can override.

TODO what if you want to override functions from the actor? presumably use the hook graph?

If you intend to use "Tick" make sure you check "Enable Mixin Tick".

Add your logic.

== Registering the Mixin

Actor Mixins must be registered in a
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc[Game Instance Module] to be applied in-game.
Create a Mod Game Instance Module if you don't already have one and add your new Mixin to the "Blueprint Hooks" array.

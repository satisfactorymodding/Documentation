= Actor Mixins

Actor Mixins are an extension of the xref:Development/ModLoader/BlueprintHooks.adoc[Blueprint Hook System]
designed to allow adding extra functionality to Unreal Actors.
After selecting an actor class to base the Mixin off of,
you are presented with a blueprint that looks as if it was the actor itself.
From there you can add actor components or set up Blueprint Hooks to call functions you define.

== Creating an Actor Mixin

Creating a Mixin is similar to creating a Blueprint Hook.

Within the Editor, create a new Blueprint of the type "Blueprint Mixin"

When creating it you will be given a prompt to choose which Actor to add the Mixin to.

The suggested asset naming format is `Mixin_ActorOrPurpose_ModReference`.

== Adding Components

Upon opening the Mixin you will be presented with an empty graph.
The components of the actor you are hooking will also be shown and use the Viewport tab to visualize them.

You can add additional components attached to anything in the actor's hierarchy.
They will appear with green text to distinguish them from the original actor's components.

== Adding Logic

By default, Mixins allow you to implement additional code for the Begin Play, Construction Script, End Play, and Tick functions on the actor.
Note that even though the editor labels these as overrides, they do not cancel the original function on the actor (TODO verify)
and are instead created as event notes.

[NOTE]
====
If you intend to use "Tick" make sure to check "Enable Mixin Tick" in the mixin class defaults.

== Adding Hooks

Since Mixins are an extension of a Blueprint Hook asset,
meaning you can open the Hook Graph window to define hooks.
These hooks always target the actor class you selected when creating the Mixin.

== Registering the Mixin

Actor Mixins must be registered in a
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc[Game Instance Module] to be applied in-game.
Create a Mod Game Instance Module if you don't already have one and add your new Mixin to the "Blueprint Hooks" array.

== Limitations and Workarounds

=== Blueprint Actors Only

The Blueprint Hooks system only works on blueprint-implemented content.
As the Actor Mixin system is an extension of the blueprint hooks system,
it only works on blueprint-implemented actors.
This rarely causes problems as most actors in Satisfactory are blueprint actors backed by {cpp} actor classes.

Notable actors that are not blueprint implemented include:

- The dropped items that spawn as loot around Drop Pods

The closest workaround for {cpp} actors would be hooking begin play,
although that is no longer using the Mixin system.

=== Level Actors and Saved Data

Actors that are spawned and streamed with the level required special handling interally to work with the actor mixin system.
As a consequence of this, SaveGame properties on components added via Mixins to level actors will not be loaded.

To work around this, save this data on something else saved instead, such as a Mod Subsystem.
Data could be associated with each component via a map of soft object references to data structs.
Using a soft reference is important here as the object could potentially be unloaded, leading to null keys in the map.

= Blueprint Hooking System

SML3.11 introduces a new Blueprint Hooking system that allows modifying the behavior of existing Blueprint functions via custom code.
Your code can be run before or after the original function and can modify the function's inputs, return values, or cancel its execution.
It can also replace individual statements or expression within the function logic.

Blueprint Hooks are created as blueprint assets and have full knowledge of blueprint asset structures and function signatures.

[NOTE]
====
Hooking of {cpp}-implemented functions is covered on the xref:Development/Cpp/hooking.adoc[Native Hooking] page.
====

A single Blueprint Hook asset can contain multiple hooks on any number of classes,
enabling you to organize your hooks as you see fit.

== Creating a Hook Blueprint

Within the Unreal Editor, create a new Blueprint of the type "Blueprint Hook"

== The Hook Graph

Blueprint Hooks offer a new graph type called the "Hook Graph".
The Hook Graph is a specialized graph that allows you to
define hooks via Target Specifier and Hook nodes.

Click the button in the editor's top bar to open it as a dockable window.
If the button is greyed out, it means you already have the window open.

== Creating Hook Graph Nodes

As with normal blueprint graphs, right clicking on empty space opens a prompt to create new nodes.
Each node has an on-hover tooltip that explains what it does.

=== Comments

Comments are invaluable for explaining the purpose of a hook and grouping multiple hooks together.

Comments can be created via the "New Comment" node, the "C" hotkey does not work.
All hook graph nodes also support Unreal's comment bubble in the top left corner.

=== Hooks

Hook nodes are used to specify what class' function you are hooking, when the hook is executed, and what custom function to call.

The following hook types are available:

* Insertion Hook - Will resolve to the statement if targeting an expression
** Before
** Replace
** After
* Redirect Hook - Must return the same type

Fill out the drop-downs to specify what class's function you are hooking.

=== Target Specifiers

Target Specifier nodes connect to the "Target Statement" pin on hook nodes.
They are used to specify which statements or expressions to match in the hooked function.
Some specifiers require another specifier chained as input.

The following target specifiers are available:

* Constant (can choose type and value)
* Experssion Operand (takes another specifier as input)
* Function Call
* Function Entry Statement
* Function Exit Statement
* Outer Expression (takes another specifier as input)
* Property Assignment
* Property Read
* Return Value Experssion
* Target Selector (first/single/all/stuff) (takes another specifier as input)

=== Connecting Hooks to Target Specifiers

All Hooks require a Target Specifier to be connected to them to tell them what part of the target function to hook.

== Hook Functions

The code executed by a hook is defined in functions within the Hook Blueprint.
The "Hook Implementation" option on hook nodes determines what function is invoked a hook node.

=== Hook Function Parameters

Hook functions parameters are populated by the hooking system based on 

The first parameter should be the type of Blueprint you are hooking.
Subsequent parameters can be any variable that is available in the hooked function's context that the hook might want to read/write. If set to be By Ref, the type must exactly match, but otherwise a wider type can be used.

Parameters will be mapped using their name to:

* `Target` - special hooking argument that resolves to the object instance the hooked function was running
* Global Variables - on the object instance
* Local Variables - function inputs, function locals, and function temps (which you can check for in a BP code dump, either via the link:#ViewingBlueprintFunctionImplementations[`-DumpBlueprintPatchingResults` launch argument] which generates pseudocode, or in xref:Development/ExtractGameFiles.adoc#FModel[FModel] which generates a json very similar to the asset dump)
* `TargetReturnValue` - special hooking argument that resolves to the hooked function's ReturnValue
* `HookTarget` - special hooking argument for insertion hooks. Resolves to the expression the hook was pointing to, if it wasn't pointing to a statement
* `AssignmentTarget` - special hooking argument for insertion hooks on assignment statements. Resolves to the variable on the left side of an assignment statement.
* `OriginalValue` - special hooking argument that resolves to the original value when using redirect hooks (replacing an expression inside a statement, rather than an insert hook which goes before/replace/after a statement). Required when using a redirect hook.

== Registering the Hook

Hook assets must be registered in a
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc[Game Instance Module] to be applied in-game.
Create a Mod Game Instance Module if you don't already have one and add your new hook to the "Blueprint Hooks" array.

== Limitations and Workarounds

=== Event Graph Nodes

Because Blueprint Hook implementations are functions, some nodes you may be used to from Event Graphs are not available,
such as Latent Action nodes like Delay.

To work around this, implement your logic in an Event Graph somewhere else,
such as a Mod Subsystem or your Mod Game World Module,
then call that event from the Hook Function.

=== Unregistering Blueprint Hooks

Once you have hooked a blueprint function, there is currently no way to unhook it without fully exiting Satisfactory.
This is why blueprint hooks are registered in a Game Instance Module.

You can work around this by having your hook code check a flag in a mod subsystem or your game instance module to determine if the hook should execute.

=== Hooking and Dedicated Servers

Some blueprints (like UI blueprints) do not exist in the dedicated server build.
If your mod attempts to hook such a blueprint in a dedicated server, it will log an error message.
You can use the global function `IsRunningDedicatedServer()` to skip hooking to avoid this error.

== Viewing Blueprint Function Implementations

Understanding what base-game blueprint functions do can be troublesome as we don't have their source code
and the starter project only contains xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/StarterProjectStructure.adoc#PlaceholderSystem[placeholders of blueprint assets].

To assist with this process, SML implements the `-DumpBlueprintPatchingResults` command line argument.
When the game is launched with this argument,
SML will dump the bytecode of all blueprint hooked functions to the log in a relatively human-readable format.

Note that it is also possible to use xref:Development/ExtractGameFiles.adoc#FModel[FModel] to dump an asset as JSON
and view the blueprint bytecode in a less-readable format.

== Examples

Check out ExampleMod, SML, and the xref:Development/OpenSourceExamples.adoc[Open Source Examples] page
for examples of existing hook blueprints.

== Blueprint Hooking from {cpp}

It is not currently possible to hook blueprint functions from {cpp} code using SML's systems.

Previous versions of SML allowed hooking blueprint functions from {cpp} code,
but because the {cpp} side is unaware of the structure of assets defined on the blueprint side,
these hooks were always in a messy and brittle state of requiring lots of reflection and hardcoded assumptions to work.
The only way to mitigate this brittleness was to have the hook call a blueprint-implemented function.
The modern system removes the middleman by having blueprint hooks defined and implemented on the asset side,
giving them full knowledge of asset structure.

If you'd like to implement the code your hooks run in {cpp},
write the code in a blueprint function library or similar and call the functions from the hook blueprint.

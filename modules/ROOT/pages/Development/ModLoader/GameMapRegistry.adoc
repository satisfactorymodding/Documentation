= Game Map Registry

Introduced in SML3.5, the Game Map Registry feature allows mods to add additional game levels without fighting each others' main menu widget blueprint hooks to add the level select UI.

SML automatically creates a Game Map Registry entry for the base game's level and populates it with the original 4 starting locations.

An example custom level and Game Map Registry entry can be found in the Example Mod shipped with the starter project.

Mods can add levels to the registry via SMLGameMapData entries in the
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc#_game_instance_bound_module_ugameinstancemodule[Game Instance Module].

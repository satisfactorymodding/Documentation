= Simple Construction Script (SCS) Hooks

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of SML 3.11, this system has been deprecated in favor of the
xref:Development/ModLoader/ActorMixins.adoc[Actor Mixins] system.

Introduced in SML3.5, Blueprint Simple Construction Script hooks allow adding modded
https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/components-in-unreal-engine/[Components]
to any blueprint-based actor.

Mods can define Blueprint SCS Hooks in their
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc#_game_instance_bound_module_ugameinstancemodule[Game Instance Module] under Class Defaults -> Advanced -> Hooks -> Blueprint SCSHooks

This system is very flexible and it is difficult to summarize its capabilities.
Here are some example usages:

* Spawn a component on the player character that does some custom logic
    ** Example Mod uses this to add a hat to the player if they have an Example Item in their inventory.
       Note that the component is always spawned, but custom logic controls if the hat is visible to the player.
* Easily track (and potentially store with the save file) per-player data that is guaranteed to exist by hooking the construction of BP_PlayerState
    ** The open-source https://ficsit.app/mod/FreeSamples[Free Samples] mod
       attaches a FreeSampleDataComponent to each BP_PlayerState with this configuration on its RootInstance_FreeSamples blueprint:

= Widget Blueprint Hooks

Introduced in SML3.5, Widget Blueprint Hooks can be used to add your custom widget into one of the existing game widgets.

This functionality is used by SML to add the 'Mods' button to the main menu and pause menu.

Mods can define widget blueprint hooks in their
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc#_game_instance_bound_module_ugameinstancemodule[Game Instance Module].

An example usage of this feature applied to the player HUD can be found in the Example Mod shipped with the starter project.

The system works on the widget archetype level so your widget ends up fully integrated into the game's asset.
You have full control over slot properties and widget settings.

[NOTE]
====
A similar effect to Widget Blueprint Hooks can be achieved by hooking the widget's construct
(for example, using Bind on BPFunction 'Construct')
and manually adding your widget via blueprint code, but this system provides a simpler and more convenient way.

== Useful Blueprint Nodes

SML offers some utility functions that make working with widget blueprint hooking cleaner and easier.

Use the editor 'Find in Blueprints' functionality to search for usage examples in SML itself.
Only a brief description of the node's purpose is provided here.
Read more information in the node's tooltip or the SMLBlueprintWidgetLibrary.h header file.

=== Find Parent Widget of Class

Traverses the outer hierarchy of the provided widget
and attempts to find the first widget of the class that be casted to the provided one and returns it.

Particularly useful for a widget that injected into another to operate on its parent widget tree to perform additional modifications or gather extra data.

This should only be used when you have very clear knowledge of your supposed parent widget.

=== Find Child Widgets Of Class

Traverses all of the direct and potentially indirect widgets owned by the provided widget tree
and attempts to find all the widgets matching the provided class.

An example use case is for obtaining and operating on children of a widget that you can't modify the implementation of.

This should only be used when you have very clear knowledge of the widget tree
since bindings and named slots should be used to implement this functionality when you do have control over the implementation.

[WARNING]
====
Note that the search process can't break through the sandboxing of child user widgets,
so you must either chain calls to this function on those child widgets
or pass the "closest" child if you have access to it.
Examples of this situation include content in named slots or widgets that use other User Widgets in their hierarchy.

= Downloading a Zip

You've chosen to download a zip of the Starter Project repository.

The below box will help you decide which repository branch to download a zip of.
It's imperative that you download the correct Starter Project version
or you will have to repeat some of the setup process again.

== What Version to Download

====
If you are looking to develop mods for Update 1.0,
follow the link:https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/v3.10.0/index.html[SML v3.10.0] documentation instead.
However, we strongly suggest developing mods for Update 1.1 instead as it will be released to the stable branch on June 10th.
====

// When updating the below, remember to update StaterProjectViaClone.adoc, StarterProjectViaZip.adoc, and dependencies.adoc (engine)
====
This is the *latest stable* version of the docs.
// This is the *development* version of the docs.

Download a zip of the **`master` branch** to develop a mod for the stable version of SML
by clicking https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[here].

// Download a zip of the **`dev` branch** (because SML 3.8.? is not released yet)
// by clicking https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/archive/refs/heads/dev.zip[here].

// You should download a zip either of the **`dev` branch** or the **`master` branch**.
// Of those two, you probably want whichever branch was pushed to most recently, which you can see
// https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/branches[on the GitHub repository].

If you're uncertain about which branch to download, **ask us on the Discord**.

== Unzipping the Files

[WARNING]
====
By default, Windows marks files downloaded from the internet as "blocked".
You will run into problems later on because of this.
To get around this issue, right-click the zip file and "unblock" it from the Properties menu before unzipping it.
====

Unzip `SatisfactoryModLoader-master.zip` (or the `-dev.zip`) to get the Starter Project files.
If you're encountering issues extracting the zip,
try using another zip extracting software
such as https://www.7-zip.org/[7zip]
or https://www.win-rar.com/start.html[WinRAR].

You can move the directory later, and you can name the outermost folder whatever you'd like.

Make sure to read the notes on the
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/StarterProject/ObtainStarterProject.adoc[Starter Project page]
about good long-term homes for your starter project files.

== Next Steps

Now that all the dependencies are installed, you can move onto
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/project_setup.adoc[setting up the project].

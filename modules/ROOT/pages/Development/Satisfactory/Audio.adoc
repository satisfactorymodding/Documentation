== Wwise

Coffee Stain uses the Wwise audio system to play sounds in Satisfactory.

To create new audio events to play in your mod you will need the Wwise project setup and integrated to the SML project.

=== Importing Media Files to Wwise

Open the Wwise project file, normally located in: `SMLProject/SMLProject_WwiseProject/SMLProject_WwiseProject.wproj` just doubling clicking this file will open Wwise.

To make sure you are in the correct layout at the top go to `Layout -> Designer`

On the lefthand side you will see the project explorer:

Under `Actor-Mixer Hierarchy` there will be `Default Work Unit`.

To keep everything organised create a new Virtual Folder and name it the same as your mod:

image:Satisfactory/Wwise/Wwise_Image2.png[Wwise_Image2, 600]

Now to import audio files!

Drag your `.wav` files into this newly created Virtual Folder. The `Audio File Importer` window will show.

Ensure that you have `Create New Objects` selected under import mode. Verify it is going to the correct folder and then click `Import`

Thats It, your audio files are now imported to Wwise!

=== Creating Audiokinetic Events

Audiokinetic Events are used to trigger audio events like Play, Pause, Stop, etc.
These are normally referred to as `AKEvents`



== ADA

See the xref:Development/Satisfactory/AdaMessages.adoc[dedicated page on ADA Messages] for more information.

== Volume Options

To retrieve the user's volume options, use "Get FGGame User Settings" and "Get Float Option Value".

To find out what CVARs to use in,
adjusting your own user setting for the value then checking your
xref:faq.adoc#Files_GameConfig[GameUserSettings.ini file] to see what they are saved as.

As of the 1.0 release update, these are the CVARs for the main volume categories:

// cspell:ignore Menu_Volume_Vehicules
```
RTPC.Menu_Volume_Master
RTPC.Menu_Volume_Dialogue
RTPC.Menu_Volume_SoundEffects
RTPC.Menu_Volume_UI
RTPC.Music_Bus_Volume
RTPC.Menu_Volume_Ambience
RTPC.Consumables_Bus_Volume
RTPC.Menu_Volume_Creatures
RTPC.Menu_Volume_Equipment
RTPC.Menu_Volume_Factory
RTPC.Menu_Volume_Foley
RTPC.Menu_Volume_Vehicules
RTPC.Menu_Volume_Weapons
```

These values are on a scale of `0.0` (off) to `1.0` (full volume).
If multiple categories apply, multiply them together to reach the final volume value.
For example, the Chainsaw's volume is probably Master multiplied with Equipment multiplied with the chainsaw's specific category.

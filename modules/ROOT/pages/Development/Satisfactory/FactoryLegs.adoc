= Factory Legs

Satisfactory machinery often includes "legs" to appear sturdily supported even when placed on uneven ground.

To set up legs on modded buildings, your building need two things:

* Named leg sockets defined on your building's mesh
    ** The https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-sockets-with-static-meshes-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3[Unreal documentation]
        covers how to add sockets to your mesh in the editor.
    ** Socket names must follow the format `foot_xx` where `xx` is a zero-left-padded number starting at `01`.
        According to CSS, this numbering format is hardcoded internally.
* FGFactoryLegs actor component on the building actor
    ** Use the "mLegSocketNames" property to specify the names of the leg sockets used on your mesh.

Note that if your building has a FGFactoryLegs component and its mesh NOT have leg sockets, the building hologram will always report that it's on uneven ground and prevent placement.

== History

Back in https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_0.3.8.9[Update 3],
Coffee Stain switched Satisfactory to being built in the Modular Build mode.
This meant that mods no longer technically needed SML to be "loaded",
so SML switched over to serving as a utility library and coordinator.

Up until the release of SML 3.8, we still required all mods uploaded to Ficsit.app to depend on SML
because it acted as a way to check which game and engine versions a mod was compatible with.
With the release of SML 3.8 we also updated Ficsit.app internals to allow mods to be uploaded without SML as a dependency,
instead using the "GameVersion" uplugin field.

== Are You Really Sure You Want to Do This?

Consider the following SML features that you'll be losing by not depending on it:

- Significant wheel reinvention required for blueprint (pak-only) mods ({cpp} mods can use StartupModule)
- xref:Development/Cpp/hooking.adoc[{cpp} hooking helpers] - SML bundles a modified version of funchook
- Mod dependency version checking at launch
- Client-server version consistency checking when playing in multiplayer
- Other mods being able to detect your mod's presence
- Mod Content Registry access

Also, consider that nearly every player will still have SML installed anyways so they can use other mods.
It's already possible to run SML on just the client.

== Systems You Will Have to Care About

Here's a list of special considerations you'll have to make if you decide to go down this path.
Every mod is different, so this will never be a comprehensive list.
Please let us know what you find out so we can update this page.

- You still need to use the Starter Project to have a working Unreal Engine project to build your mod with.
- Your mod breaking on game updates. {cpp} code, especially hooks, are very prone to breaking on game updates as offsets change.
- Entry point for your code. {cpp} mods can use `StartupModule`, blueprint mods will need something else to help them load.
- Alpakit GameVersion dependency field explained on the xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/ReleaseMod.adoc#_special_fields[Releasing Your Mod page].
- Not conflicting with any systems that SML uses, because there is a very high chance that end users will already have SML installed.

= Unreal Editor

The Unreal Editor should have been installed during the
xref:/Development/BeginnersGuide/index.adoc[Getting Started setup process].
This is your IDE where you will spend the most time in to add especially
"visible" content called `assets`. But it's also used to add simple
logic to your mod with an integrated visual programming language called
Blueprints.

[TIP]
====
If you want to learn more about `Blueprints` and the so called
`UObject-System` we recommend you the concept page for
xref:Development/UnrealEngine/BluePrints.adoc[Blueprints]
and Unreal's documentation on the UObject system.

We recommend the https://academy.unrealengine.com/[Unreal Academy] for
learning more about the concepts and deep topics of Unreal Engine itself
(like Particle System, advanced Blueprints, and so on)

= Third Party Libraries

Adding third-party {cpp} libaries to your mod is possible but requires some additional setup.
The third party library must be included as a Module in your mod plugin.

== Module Definition

You must first create a directory structure that follows this example:
`Mods/<mod_reference>/Source/ThirdParty/<third_party>Library/`
and place a file named after that library in the directory called `<third_party>Library.Build.cs`

The file must contain a class named after the module, and references to any include paths and library paths.

The recommended structure is
`inc` (or `include`) containing the library header files,
and `lib/<PlatformName>` containing the compiled library files,
where `<PlatformName>` is one of the
https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Configuration/UEBuildTarget.cs#L254-L292[Unreal Target Platform names].
Currently, Satisfactory is released for `Win64` and `Linux`.

[source,cs]
----
using System.IO;
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class <third_party>Library : ModuleRules
{
    public <third_party>Library(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = ModuleType.External;
        PublicIncludePaths.Add(Path.Combine(ModuleDirectory, "inc"));

        var PlatformName = Target.Platform.ToString();

        var LibFolder = Path.Combine(ModuleDirectory, "lib", PlatformName);
        if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Win64)
        {
            PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(Path.Combine(LibFolder, "<third_party1>.lib"));
            PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(Path.Combine(LibFolder, "<third_party2>.lib")); // If the third party library is composed of multiple .lib files
        }
        else if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Linux)
        {
            PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(Path.Combine(LibFolder, "lib<third_party1>.a"));
            PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(Path.Combine(LibFolder, "lib<third_party2>.a")); // If the third party library is composed of multiple .a files
        }
    }
}
----

== Shared (Dynamic) Libraries

Shared libraries need some additional setup,
since the runtime linker only looks for shared libraries under the relevant `Binaries/<PlatformName>` folders of Plugins, Mods, and the game.

To have the `.dll` or `.so` files copied from the source folder to `Binaries`,
you can make use of the `RuntimeDependencies` list of the module.
This marks files that should be included in the build output of the mod,
and can additionally copy files to a different location than the original one, which is what you need for shared libraries.

[WARNING]
====
Unreal Engine overrides the `new` and `delete` functions using its custom memory management system.
Because of this, passing STL objects to/from externally compiled shared libraries is not possible,
as they will be allocated with one `new` function on one side, and deallocated with an unmatched `delete` function on the other. 
Doing so will result in a crash similar to `FMallocBinned2 Attempt to realloc an unrecognized block 0000023E58B80000 canary == 0x0 != 0xe3`

public class <third_party>Library : ModuleRules
{
    public <third_party>Library(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = ModuleType.External;
        PublicIncludePaths.Add(Path.Combine(ModuleDirectory, "inc"));

        var PlatformName = Target.Platform.ToString();

        var LibFolder = Path.Combine(ModuleDirectory, "lib", PlatformName);
        if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Win64)
        {
            PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(Path.Combine(LibFolder, "<third_party1>.lib"));
            PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(Path.Combine(LibFolder, "<third_party2>.lib")); // If the third party library is composed of multiple .lib files
        }
        else if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Linux)
        {
            PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(Path.Combine(LibFolder, "lib<third_party1>.a"));
            PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(Path.Combine(LibFolder, "lib<third_party2>.a")); // If the third party library is composed of multiple .a files
        }

        RuntimeDependencies.Add("$(BinaryOutputDir)", Path.Combine(LibFolder, "*.dll")); // Windows
        RuntimeDependencies.Add("$(BinaryOutputDir)", Path.Combine(LibFolder, "*.so")); // Linux
    }
}

== Module Usage

After you have defined the third party module, you need to reference it in your mod's base module's `<mod_reference>.Build.cs` file as a public dependency.

[source,cpp]
----
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {"<third_party>Library"});
----

== Import Errors

Unreal Engine has stricter standards about what warnings are treated as errors,
but some libraries ignore those warnings as they are non-critical to their use case.

In those cases, you need to wrap any imports from that library in several layers of compatibility macros and headers.

[source,cpp]
----
#include "Windows/WindowsHWrapper.h"
#include "Windows/AllowWindowsPlatformTypes.h"
#include "Windows/AllowWindowsPlatformAtomics.h"

PRAGMA_PUSH_PLATFORM_DEFAULT_PACKING
THIRD_PARTY_INCLUDES_START

#pragma push_macro("check")
#undef check

<your_imports_here>

#pragma pop_macro("check")

THIRD_PARTY_INCLUDES_END
PRAGMA_POP_PLATFORM_DEFAULT_PACKING

#include "Windows/HideWindowsPlatformAtomics.h"
#include "Windows/HideWindowsPlatformTypes.h"
----

If you are getting errors from compiling the library
even after wrapping the imports,
you will need to fix those errors and recompile the library.

== Multiple Mods Using the Same Third Party Library

If you plan to develop multiple mods using the same external library
you should consider creating a dependency mod to hold the library.
Although there shouldn't be any issues at runtime if each mod contains the library as a module (untested),
at development time, Unreal will complain about it when building if both mods are in the project at the same time
and the third party module name is the same in both.

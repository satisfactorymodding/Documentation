IMPORTANT: Before following this guide you should read the [Link to new hooking doc] to get an overview of the new system and how to create hooks using it.

Migrating a Blueprint hook is easy because you already have all the information you need in the old "Bind on BPFunction" node.

This gives you the information required to make a Blueprint Hook using the new system:

- Class
- Function to hook
- Before or After

Now follow the instruction from the [Link to new hooking doc] to create a new hook. In the hook Blueprint you just plug in those values from your old Bind on BPFunction node:

Set the Class and Function being hooked, then for Hook Reference you'll set whatever function you have your logic in. 

The "Hook Offset Start" checkbox lets you know what kind of Hook Statement to make. If it isn't checked then you will want to make a "Hook After" statement and if it is checked then you will want to make a "Hook Before" statement.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to register your new Hook as described in [Link to new hooking doc]

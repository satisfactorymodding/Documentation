====
Before following this guide you should read the xref:Development/ModLoader/BlueprintHooks.adoc[Blueprint Hooks] page
to get an overview of the new system and how to create hooks using it.

Migrating a Blueprint hook is easy because you already have all the information you need in the old "Bind on BPFunction" node.

This gives you the information required to make a Blueprint Hook using the new system:

- Class
- Function to hook
- Before or After

Now follow the instruction from the xref:Development/ModLoader/BlueprintHooks.adoc[Blueprint Hooks] guide to create a new hook.

Plug in the values from your old Bind on BPFunction node to your new hook blueprint:

The "Hook Offset Start" checkbox lets you know what kind of Hook Statement to make.
If it isn't checked, make a "Hook After" statement, and if it is checked, make a "Hook Before" statement.

Next, set the Class and Function being hooked.

For Hook Reference, set whatever function you have your logic in.
Note that the previous system had hooks as Events and the new system has them as Functions, preventing the use of latent nodes like Delay.

[WARNING]
====
Don't forget to register your new Hook as described in the xref:Development/ModLoader/BlueprintHooks.adoc[Blueprint Hooks] page.

= Migrating SCS Hooks to Mixins

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before following this guide you should read the xref:Development/ModLoader/ActorMixins.adoc[Actor Mixins] page
to get an overview of the new system and how to create Mixins using it.
====

Migrating from a SCS Hook to a Mixin is easy because you already have all the information you need in your Mod Game Instance Module.

New SCS Hooks cannot be made, but old ones will remain so you can use them when migrating to Mixins.

From this old information we get:

- Actor being attached to
- Parent Component
- Component with your logic

Now follow the instruction from the xref:Development/ModLoader/ActorMixins.adoc[Actor Mixins] page to create a new Mixin.
When prompted for the Mixin Target use the one from the "Actor Class" in your old SCS Hook:

From here you can add any logic you had in your old SCS Component into your new Mixin.
Make sure to set any of the settings from your SCS hooks' actor component template(s) on the new component(s) you add to the Mixin,
assuming your editor displays the template, as a now-irrelevant bug prevented the option from being presented in most circumstances.

[WARNING]
====
Don't forget to register your new Mixin as described in the xref:Development/ModLoader/ActorMixins.adoc[Actor Mixins] page.

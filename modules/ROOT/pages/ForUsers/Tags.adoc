The Satisfactory Mod Repository (ficsit.app) features a tag system to help users find mods relevant to them.
Example tags include "buildings", "equipment", "quality of life", and "cheats".

You can also search for mods based on tags.
For example, if you want to find all mods that add new equipment, you can search for the "equipment" tag.

The list of tags is managed by the site moderators to avoid an abundance of low-mod-count tags,
but you can suggest new tags in the on our Discord server.

Mod developers and site moderators can attach tags to mods on the mod edit page.

= Installing Mods on Dedicated Servers

TODO write this page (it's hidden from the sidebar for now)

== Install the Vanilla Server

The first step is to obtain a copy of the vanilla dedicated server.
The Satisfactory Official Wiki already has a
https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Dedicated_servers[detailed guide covering how to do this].

== Install Ficsit-CLI

https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/ficsit-cli

== Import Profile from SMM

Suggest importing a profile you configured locally instead of browsing via the CLI
since it helps ensure installed versions will match.

== Configuring Mods on Servers

Configure the mod client side and copy the config files over to avoid making syntax mistakes when editing config files.
Also, some mods could stop working correctly if client and server configs don't match,
so this is a good way to ensure they match.

Check the xref:faq.adoc#Files_ModConfig[FAQ on where game files are located] to see where config files are stored.

== Third Party Server Hosts

TODO Can we expect them to have ficsit CLI installed?
Tell people to follow the server provider's instructions for installing mods.

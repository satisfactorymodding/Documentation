= Installing Mods on Dedicated Servers

[IMPORTANT]
====
Dedicated Server support is still a work in progress,
which is why we haven't publicly announced it yet!

Expect changes to the setup process as functionality is finalized
and be patient as mods are updated 
====

SML3.7.0 enables the compilation of mods for Dedicated Servers.
Keep in mind that Coffee Stain considers the base game's dedicated servers to be
an experimental, incomplete feature, so modded dedicated servers are experimental squared!
Expect bugs and test carefully to determine if bugs are caused by the base game or by mods
before reporting them on the https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/[QA site] (base-game)
or the Discord (modded) respectively.

[id="SelfHostedServer"]
== Option 1: Self Hosted Server

Hosting a server yourself is the best way to
ensure you can work with the files required to get modded a server working.
First, set up a copy of the vanilla dedicated server if you haven't done so yet.
The Satisfactory Official Wiki already has a
https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Dedicated_servers[detailed guide covering how to do this].
Follow that guide, then continue to the link:#GetModManager[next section].

[id="ThirdPartyServer"]
== Option 2: Third Party Hosted Server

[WARNING]
====
We can only provided limited support for third-party hosted servers
as we do not know or control their systems.
Contact your server host's support lines if you encounter problems.
====

Third-party server hosts often restrict how you can access and modify files on the system,
complicating the mod setup process.

You will have to follow your server host's own documentation about mod setup.
If your server host provides (s)ftp access to server files
the Mod Manager and ficsit-cli _should_ be able to interact with them normally.

With this in mind, continue to the link:#GetModManager[next section].

[id="GetModManager"]
== Install Satisfactory Mod Manager or ficsit-cli

Both Satisfactory Mod Manager (version 3.0.0 and up) and ficsit-cli
can be used to manage mods on a remote server installation
as long as you have network filesystem or (s)ftp access to the server.
You could also install ficsit-cli on the server and interact with its file system directly via its terminal user interface.

[id="GetModManager_SMM"]
=== Mod Manager

[NOTE]
====
Entering servers by filesystem path (including SMB/CIFS or network mounts) is not currently an option in SMM, use ficsit-cli in the mean time.
====

If using the Mod Manage to manage your server:

1. xref:ForUsers/SatisfactoryModManager.adoc[Download and install the Satisfactory Mod Manager].
2. Open the Mod Manager.
3. In the left panel, under Other, select "Manage Servers".
4. Enter server connection details in the popup window.
  a. The link:#FileTransferMethods[File Transfer Methods] section has more information regarding FTP/SFTP configurations.
5. The server will now appear in your Game Version dropdown and can be managed like a local install.
6. Skim the below ficsit-cli section to stay informed, then continue reading.

[id="GetModManager_CLI"]
=== ficsit-cli

If using ficsit-cli to manage your server:

1. Download https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/ficsit-cli[ficsit-cli]
   either to your computer or to the server itself
   depending on which environment you are more comfortable working with.
2. Run the application in a terminal window.
3. Navigate to the "Installations" > "New Installation" screen.
4. Enter server connection details in the popup window.
  a. If the server is not hosted locally to ficsit-cli, enter the server connection details. 
   - The link:#FileTransferMethods[File Transfer Methods] section has more information regarding FTP/SFTP/SMB configurations.
  b. Otherwise, use the file system path necessary, for example `D:\SatisfactoryDS` or `/opt/SatisfactoryDedicatedServer`.
5. The server will now appear as an install you can select and manage as usual.
6. Read the below, then continue to the next article heading.

Make sure to apply changes after installing mods or loading a profile,
otherwise all changes will be discarded on exit.

Note that applying changes in ficsit-cli is a global action -
all installations the program is aware of will have any staged changes they may have applied in parallel.
This does _not_ mean that all installs must be on the same profile.

[id="FileTransferMethods"]
== File Transfer Methods

=== FTP - File Transfer Protocol

File transfer protocol (FTP) is a common, but outdated method to transfer files over the Internet/Network. 
The commonly used port number is TCP/21.
The examples provided are for a self-hosted dedicated server.

The authenticating user requires Read/Write/Delete or Read/Modify permissions.

The path required for FTP to be used is the following:
`ftp://username:password@ServerNameOrIP:Port/path/`

.Ficsit-CLI FTP Example

=== SFTP - Secure File Transfer Protocol

Secure File transfer protocol (SFTP) is a common method to transfer files over the Internet/Network. 
The commonly used port number is TCP/22. 
The examples provided are for a self-hosted dedicated server.

The authenticating user requires Read/Write/Delete or Read/Modify permissions.

The path required for SFTP to be used is the following:
`sftp://username:password@ServerNameOrIP:Port/path/`

.Satisfactory Mod Manager SFTP Example

=== SMB/CIFS - Server Message Block/Common Internet File System _(i.e. Windows Network Share)_ 

[WARNING]
====
This feature is currently only supported on ficsit-cli. A future release (soon(TM)) of Satisfactory Mod Manager shall support SMB/CIFS.
====

Server Message Block (SMB) is also commonly known as Windows File Shares or CIFS (Common Internet File System) is a common method to transfer files over a Network, commonly on Windows Systems, but may be used on Linux/Unix Systems. 
The commonly used port number is TCP/445.
The examples provided are for a self-hosted dedicated server.

The authenticating user requires Read/Write/Delete or Read/Modify permissions.

The path required for SMB/CIFS to be used is the following: +
Windows Ficsit-CLI: `\\ServerNameOrIP\ShareName\Path` or
`//ServerNameOrIP/ShareName/Path`

Linux Ficsit-CLI: _There is currently a bug that is being worked on. Solution to be soon(tm)._

[id="ImportProfile"]
== Import a Profile Created in SMM

Although it is possible to use ficsit-cli or the Mod Manager to install mods one-by-one,
this is not recommended as you could end up with a mismatch between client and server mod versions,
preventing you from connecting.

The suggested approach is to create a xref:ForUsers/SatisfactoryModManager.adoc[Mod Manager] profile
on your own computer for your client
then xref:ForUsers/SatisfactoryModManager.adoc#_sharing_profiles[use the Import/Export Profile functionality]
to produce a file that can be imported into the Mod Manager.
You can then send out this same profile file to the client players so they can configure their own installs accordingly.

== Configuring Mods on Servers

There is not currently an interface for adjusting mod configurations remotely on dedicated servers.
As a result, you should configure mods client side and copy the config files over to the server.

Note that some mods could stop working correctly or behave unexpectedly if client and server configs don't match.

Check the xref:faq.adoc#Files_ModConfig[FAQ on where game files are located] to see where config files are stored.

== (Not supported) Manual Mod Installation

[WARNING]
====
We do not provide support on the Discord for dedicated servers that have had mods manually installed.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do NOT naively copy-paste your client's mods folder to a server - this will not work!
The compiled files used by the game client will not work on dedicated servers,
so trying to give them client files will result in vague error messages.
====

It is possible to manually install mods on dedicated server installs
without the help of the Mod Manager of ficsit-cli,
however the process of doing so will vary based on your server
and you will have to manually ensure you have downloaded compatible versions and all of their dependencies.

The steps described in the xref:ManualInstallDirections.adoc[Manual Installation]
directions for clients still generally apply,
but be sure to download the correct target platform version of the mod for your server.

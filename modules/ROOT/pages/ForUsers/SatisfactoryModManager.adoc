= Using Satisfactory Mod Manager

[TIP]
====
Answers to frequent questions and troubleshooting steps for using the Mod Manager
can be found on the xref:faq.adoc[Frequently Asked Questions] page.
====

The Satisfactory Mod Manager (SMM) allows players to easily install
mods, their dependencies, and the Mod Loader (SML) with minimal hassle.
It connects to https://ficsit.app/[the Mod Repository (SMR)],
allowing for quick and easy installation of all mods.

The Mod Manager handles downloading the right files and putting them in the right place for you,
so even if you launch the game from outside the Mod Manager (ex. normal Steam/Epic launch)
mods will still be loaded.

[id="Installation"]
== Installing the Mod Manager

Installing the Mod Manager is covered on the
xref:faq.adoc#_how_do_i_install_mods[Frequently Asked Questions] page.

// TODO move those steps here?

== Detecting your Game Installation Directory

After you've installed the Mod Manager it will automatically detect your game installation,
and if you have multiple, you can pick between them with the "Install" dropdown.

If your game install is not automatically detected,
try xref:faq.adoc#_the_mod_manager_cant_find_my_game[following the steps linked here].

We do not provide support for pirated copies of the game.

== Finding Mods

=== Via the Mod Manager

Browse the list of available mods by scrolling, or search for a mod with the search bar.
Click on a mod to open its mod page in an details panel to the side.

If you're looking for new mods to use, make sure that your "Show" dropdown is set to "Compatible".

=== Via ficsit.app

If you prefer to browse mods on the ficsit.app website,
it's easy to install mods from there too.

Once you're on the page for a mod, click the 'Versions' button in the top right,
then click the "Install" button near the version you'd like to download.
// TODO after SMR frontend dedi changes come in: click the Download arrow icon in the "Latest Versions" section to install the mod via the mod manager.
This will prompt you to allow the website to communicate with your installed copy of the Mod Manager
and handle installing the mod for you.

== Installing Mods

To install a mod, click the download arrow button.
After the download completes, it will turn into another icon depending on its compatibility status.

== Managing Mods

You can use the "Show" dropdown to filter what mods are displayed.
Here is what each option of the dropdown does:

- `Compatible` will only display mods that are compatible with your selected game install's branch (Early Access or Experimental).
  **This is the suggested mode to keep the Manager in when searching for new mods to use.**
  Learn more about compatibility statuses link:#_do_mods_work_with_experimental[here].
- `All Mods` will show every mod on Ficsit.app, regardless of if they work with your game version.
- The `Enabled` option will show all mods that will load when you launch the game.
  These mods are here either because you have manually chosen to install them,
  or because they were automatically installed as requirements of other mods.
  You can Pause these mods to keep them from loading when you launch the game.
- The `Disabled` option shows mods you have downloaded but "paused" which means they will not be loaded.
- The `Installed` option shows all mods that you have downloaded, regardless of if they have been paused or not.
- `Favorite` will show mods you have clicked the "star" button on to mark as a favorite.
  A mod being favorited has no relation to whether or not it is installed.

== Sharing Profiles



== Uninstalling Mods

The mod manager handles putting mod files in the relevant locations in your game install.
If you launch the game outside of the mod manager,
those files will still be in those folders, so you will still have your mods loaded.
If you want to turn off mods, you must disable them **from the mod manager** so the files get removed.

To remove a mod from your system, use the button that has taken the place of the download arrow -
it will turn into a trash can when you hover over it.

Alternatively, click the Play button to "Pause" the mod,
preventing it from loading with the game but still keeping the files downloaded on your computer.
This can be useful if you want to temporarily turn a mod off for troubleshooting something.

If you're trying to remove a specific mod from your mod manager profile and it's not working,
try creating a new profile.
You could also try
link:#_how_do_i_share_my_mods_with_my_friends_for_multiplayer[exporting your profile],
editing the file to delete the mod listing, then importing it again.

== Turning Off All Mods

To turn off mods entirely, flip the "Mods" switch in the top left corner of the mod manager.

image:FAQ/TurnOffMods.png[Satisfactory Mod Manager Off Switch]

If this fails for some reason, go to `%appdata%\SatisfactoryModManager\profiles` and delete the vanilla folder,
then restart SMM and turn mods on and back off.

If for some reason this still doesn't work, delete the "Mods" folder from your
xref:faq.adoc#_where_are_my_game_files_located[game's install directory].

Do note **uninstalling the mod manager will not uninstall mods from your game**.
If you did that, you should reinstall the mod manager and turn the mods off using the above approach.

[id="InstallSpecificModVersion"]
== Installing a Specific Version of a Mod

By default, the Mod Manager will install the latest version of a mod that it thinks is compatible with your game version.
However, it will avoid versions that end in a prerelease tag (ex. `1.0.0-PrereleaseTagHere`).

If you want to install a specific version of a mod, such as a prerelease version,
first install the mod normally.
Afterwards, a "Mod Version Options" dropdown will appear in the mod description panel.
Use this dropdown to select the version you want to install.

== Source Code

The Mod Manager is written in (TODO mention electron+TS here or Go?) and is open source.
You can find the source code on
https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLauncher/releases[GitHub]!

= Installing Mods and Using the Satisfactory Mod Manager

====
Answers to frequent questions and troubleshooting steps for using the Mod Manager
can be found on the xref:faq.adoc[Frequently Asked Questions] page.
====

The Satisfactory Mod Manager (SMM) allows players to easily install
mods, their dependencies, and the Mod Loader (SML) with minimal hassle.
It connects to https://ficsit.app/[the Mod Repository (SMR)],
allowing for quick and easy installation of all mods.

The Mod Manager handles downloading the right files and putting them in the right place for you,
so even if you launch the game from outside the Mod Manager (ex. normal Steam/Epic launch)
mods will still be loaded.

[TIP]
====
The Satisfactory Mod Manager (SMM) and Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML) are two different things!

_SMM_ is the app that you download and interact with.
It downloads files (mods and SML) to where they should go, so that you don't need to deal with them.

_SML_ is the mod loader which provides APIs that mods use to cleanly interact with the game.
You don't need to do anything for SML - SMM will handle updating it for you!

[id="Installation"]
== Installing the Mod Manager

1. Launch the game to the title screen at least once on your computer.
You've probably already done this!

2. Download the Satisfactory Mod Manager.
You can download it from ficsit.app or at https://smm.ficsit.app/,
which automatically selects the correct download from the latest GitHub release based on your browser info.
You can manually download for a specific platform from the
https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModManager/releases[GitHub releases page].

3. Depending on your browser, you may need to take some additional steps to convince it to download the file.
Check your browser's download queue to see if it claims the mod manager "is not commonly downloaded".
Optionally, learn more about why this message appears
xref:faq.adoc#_are_satisfactory_mods_safe[here].
  - On Chrome, click the "Keep" button.
  - On Edge, click on the three-dots menu, select the "Keep" option,
    click "Show More", then click "Keep anyway".
4. Go to the heading that matches what operating system you're using and follow the steps below to install it.

Wondering why you get the "unknown publisher" warning?
Learn more xref:faq.adoc#_are_satisfactory_mods_safe[here].

[id="Install_Win11"]
=== For Windows 11:

The installation process should be similar to that of Windows 10, but if you encounter a popup like this:

image:FAQ/win11_subtle_block.png[Windows 11 "Search for app in store?" popup for untrusted installers]

Ignore it because it is not correct. Instead, right-click on the installer in your file manager and go to the properties tab.

image:FAQ/smm_installer_properties_unblock.png[The properties window for the SMM installer]

Click the "Unblock" box and hit OK or Apply. Then try running it again, and it should work. Refer to the above illustration
for the rest of the steps.

[id="Install_Linux"]
=== Linux

Linux builds of the mod manager can be found on the
https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModManager/releases[GitHub releases page].
You can directly download the latest release appimage by clicking
https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModManager/releases/latest/download/Satisfactory-Mod-Manager.AppImage[this link].

The GitHub page also offers a standalone version
but you must have `+webkit2gtk-4.1+` installed to use it.

[id="Install_Winget"]
=== With Winget

If you have
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/[winget]
installed you can install the mod manager by running this command in a command prompt:

`winget install SatisfactoryModding.SatisfactoryModManager`.

[id="Install_Mac"]
=== Mac

Satisfactory does not officially support Mac,
but you can use various technologies outside the scope of this guide,
such as CrossOver, to get it running.

Satisfactory Mod Manager itself can run natively on Macs without any additional software.

== Managing Game Installations

=== Detecting your Game Installation Directory

After you've installed the Mod Manager it will automatically detect your game installation,
and if you have multiple, you can pick between them with the "Install" dropdown.

image:FAQ/SmmSelectInstall.png[Screenshot of open dropdown picker showing multiple game installs listings]

If your game install is not automatically detected,
try xref:faq.adoc#_the_mod_manager_cant_find_my_game[following the steps linked here].

We do not provide support for pirated copies of the game.

=== Dedicated Servers

Satisfactory Mod Manager can also manage mods on local or remote dedicated servers.
They appear in the Game Installation dropdown once added.
You can read more on the xref:ForUsers/DedicatedServerSetup.adoc[Installing Mods on Dedicated Servers] page.

== Installing Mods

To install a mod, simply click the download arrow button next to its listing in the Mod Manager.
After the download completes, it will turn into another icon depending on its compatibility status.

The mod manager handles putting mod files in the relevant locations in your game install.
**If you launch the game outside of the mod manager,**
those files will still be in those folders, so **you will still have your mods loaded!**

If you're encountering issues while trying to download mods,
check the xref:faq.adoc[Frequently Asked Questions] page for common fixes.

== Managing Mods

You can use the funnel dropdown to filter what mods are displayed in the search panel.
Here is what each option of the dropdown does:

- `All Mods` shows every mod on Ficsit.app, regardless of if they work with your game version.
- `Compatible` only displays mods that are compatible with your currently selected game install.
  **This is the suggested mode to keep the Manager in when searching for new mods to use.**
  Learn more about compatibility statuses xref:faq.adoc#_do_mods_work_with_experimental[here].
- `Favorite` shows mods you have clicked the "star" button on to mark as a favorite.
  A mod being favorited has no relation to whether or not it is installed.
- `Queued` shows mods that have a pending operation to perform, such as downloading, uninstalling, or updating.
- The `Installed` option shows all mods that you have directly chosen to download, regardless of if they have been paused or not.
- The `Dependency` option shows all mods that have been downloaded because they are required by another mod you Installed to function.
- The `Not Installed` is the opposite of Installed, only showing mods that you have not directly chosen to download.
  This still includes mods that are dependencies of other mods you have installed.
- `Enabled` shows all mods that will load when you launch the game.
  It's a combination of the Installed and Dependency options.
- `Disabled` is the opposite of Enabled, only showing mods you have downloaded but have "paused," which means they will not be loaded.
  Dependency mods will never show up here because they are removed when no other enabled mods require them.

== Profiles

Profiles are a convenient way to manage a collection of mods.
Use them to switch between different sets of mods for different playthroughs or multiplayer sessions.

You can create, rename, and delete profiles using the buttons near the dropdown.

image:FAQ/CreateProfile.png[Creating a new profile]

Use the dropdown to pick which profile you have selected.
Selecting a profile will immediately unload the mods from the previous profile
and set up the mods in the new profile.

Add or remove mods from a profile by using the mod manager as normal with that profile selected.

=== Sharing Profiles

The mod manager allows you to export your profile as a file others can import to install the same mods.

image:FAQ/SmmImportExport.png[SMM Import/Export screenshot]

If you're looking to share your mods list in a more human-readable format,
use the "Copy mods list" option in the "Mod Manager Settings" menu.

== Uninstalling Mods

If you want to turn off mods, you must disable them **from the mod manager** so the files get removed.

To remove a mod from your system, use the box-check button that has taken the place of the download arrow -
it will turn into a trash can when you hover over it.

Alternatively, click the Play button to "Pause" the mod,
preventing it from loading with the game but still keeping the files downloaded on your computer.
This can be useful if you want to temporarily turn a mod off for troubleshooting something.

If you're trying to remove a specific mod from your mod manager profile and it's not working,
try creating a new profile.
You could also try
link:#_how_do_i_share_my_mods_with_my_friends_for_multiplayer[exporting your profile],
editing the file to delete the mod listing, then importing it again.

== Turning Off All Mods

To turn off mods entirely, click "Mods off" in the top left corner of the mod manager.

image:FAQ/TurnOffMods.png[Satisfactory Mod Manager Off Switch]

If this fails for some reason, delete the "Mods" folder from your
xref:faq.adoc#_where_are_my_game_files_located[game's install directory] manually.

[id="InstallSpecificModVersion"]
== Installing a Specific Version of a Mod

By default, the Mod Manager will install the latest version of a mod that it thinks is compatible with your game version.
However, it will avoid versions that end in a prerelease tag (ex. `1.0.0-PrereleaseTagHere`).

If you want to install a specific version of a mod, such as a prerelease version,
click the mod's listing to expand the description panel
then click the "Change version" dropdown.
Click the left side of an entry to lock to exactly that version.
Click the right side of an entry to lock to that version or newer.

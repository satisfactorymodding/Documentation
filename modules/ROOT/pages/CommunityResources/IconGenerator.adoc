= Icon Generation

Some community members have created editor plugins that allow you to semi-automatically
create icon images from item and building descriptors at a number of resolutions.
This is helpful if you've already created a model for your content, and you want
to create UI icons for it that are consistent with those from the base game.

== Kyrium's Icon Generator

Kyrium's tool captures images using a render target, allowing capture of materials with opacity.

You can learn more about how to download and use the plugin on its https://git.kyrium.space/sf-modding/publictools/kiconmaker[Gitlab page].

== Nog's Icon Generator

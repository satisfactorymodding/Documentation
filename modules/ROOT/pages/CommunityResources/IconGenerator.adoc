= Icon Generation

Some community members have created editor plugins that allow you to semi-automatically
create icon images from item and building descriptors at a number of resolutions.
This is helpful if you've already created a model for your content, and you want
to create UI icons for it that are consistent with those from the base game.

== Beaver's Icon Generator

Beaver's tool offers batching functionality for generating icons for multiple items at once
and the ability to save settings between icon capture sessions.

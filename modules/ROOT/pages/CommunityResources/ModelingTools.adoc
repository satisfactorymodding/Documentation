Community member AngryBeaver maintains a repository of re-modeled 'pieces'
of base Satisfactory buildings that are quite useful in creating your own
factory building models. 

These re-models have been optimized to have fewer vertices than the
pieces of machines that one could take off of Satisfactory machines
exported via xref:Development/ExtractGameFiles.adoc#FModel[FModel], and they still look great!

You can read more about the Modeling Tools on its

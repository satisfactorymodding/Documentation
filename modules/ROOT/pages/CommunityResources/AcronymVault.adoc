=== Coffee Stain Studios (CSS)

_Not_ https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html[cascading style sheets].

https://www.coffeestainstudios.com/[Coffee Stain Studios]
is the Swedish game studio that created Satisfactory.

=== Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)

SML is a community-created mod that provides
an easy way for other mods to register content,
interface with the game, offer user-facing configuration options, and more.

Ironically, SML has changed so much since its creation that it is no longer responsible for loading mods.
Thanks to the helpful folks at CSS, mods are now Unreal Engine plugins,
and no longer require any special injection code to load.

Although it is possible to create a mod that does not depend on SML, they are very uncommon, as there are few reasons to do so.

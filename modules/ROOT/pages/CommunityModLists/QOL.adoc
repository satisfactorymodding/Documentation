== Background Info

This list was initially written by https://ficsit.app/user/6dvhEL4fWEqwcg[Deantendo]
as a SMR Guide, then later updated by https://ficsit.app/user/5gaZx7HvvPEE2[DaLumma], https://ficsit.app/user/CmPjgRZdvqMk96[Savage] and https://ficsit.app/user/DBWiJ9ex1jamom[Ficsit Industries]

**Last Update: 11/25/2023, https://ficsit.app/user/12NfPnFLRcnmRP[xXdrewbaccaXx]**

The SMR Guide format was difficult for the community to revise,
so it was moved here to the docs instead.
Contribution history is now tracked by the git commit history.
